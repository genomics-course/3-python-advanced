    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are one of the most useful objects in Python. They provide a mapping between (`key`, `value`) pairs, and represent a fast and efficient way of creating look-up tables. A simple example use for a dictionary would be something like mapping names to phone numbers or addresses. In genomics, we might map sample names to DNA sequences. Using the dictionary we could then query a `key` (e.g., a person's name) and it will return the `value` associated with that key (e.g., an address). \n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are very fast and flexible for storing different types of data, and of various sizes. Once you master dictionaries you'll find yourself using them all the time. "

The second form is more commonly used so I will use that in all following examples. In the curly bracket format `keys` are matched with `values` by a colon, and `key/value` pairs are separated by commas. "

    "### Common use case\n",
    "A common way to work with dictionaries is to start with an empty dictionary at the beginning of an iteration (e.g., a for-loop) and to fill elements of the dictionary as you iterate over elements of the list. Dictionaries are useful for this because you can quickly query whether an element that you visit in the iteration is already in the dictionary or not. Let's consider an example where we use a dictionary as a counter. We'll store names as keys, and integers as values. \n",
    "\n",
