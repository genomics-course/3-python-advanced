    "The `subprocess` module from the Python standard library is a powerful tool for writing Python pipeline programs -- software that acts as glue to stick together inputs and outputs of many other programs into a single program. This is a common use for Python, where its readability and ease-of-use makes it well suited for the \"glue\" role. The programs being glued together are often much faster software tools, optimized for speed much more than Python, such as those written in C or Fortran. As an example, here we will use `subprocess` to call a number of shell programs (those you would run in your bash terminal). This is only one example. You could use `subprocess` to call any binary executable program, or even to call the execution of scripts in other programming languages, like R or Java. "

    "Now that you have imported the subprocess module, what can we do with it? And where can we learn what to do with it? As with all modules in the standard library, `subprocess` is well documented with many examples online. The first place to look should be the [official Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html). This is useful, but sometimes it dives a bit too deep into technical details. So if you want instead just a simple tutorial with examples, the best practice is to google something like \"Python subprocess example\". This will surely bring up many hits. Finally, it's worth noting that like any language Python evolves over time. The `subprocess` module is a good example. There are several functions in it that are available only in Python3 but not Python2. This is something to be aware of if you are writing code for a very general audience, which may be stuck on very outdated versions of Python. Fortunately, for scientific programming we can assume that our users *should* be able to install up-to-date versions of Python."

    "### Jupyter uses `subprocess` under-the-hood for bash-magic\n",
    "You have actually used `subprocess` already, you just weren't aware of it. In a previous assignment we used \"bash-magic\" to call bash code from jupyter. The two code cells below provide examples of this. In the first, we use the `%%bash` header to tell the entire cell to execute as bash code. In the latter we can execute a single line as bash code using an exclamation mark. Pretty cool and easy to use. So why do we even need to learn `subprocess` for calling bash code if it is so easy? The answer is that the bash-magic commands are specific to jupyter (interactive Python) but we will often want to write Python code that can execute bash commands even from normal Python scripts. Moreover, it turns out the the bash-magic's themselves are simply using `subprocess` under the hood. So to understand how these work, we should understand how `subprocess` works. "

That's a long-winded way of saying that when the command you want to run in subprocess includes multiple arguments, they must be entered as a list, like in the example below.
