The numpy library is a *third party* Python library, meaning that it is not distributed by default with every Python installation. It can be easily installed however, and provides a huge suite of tools for scientific computing. I think that the assigned Chapter introduces numpy very well, so this notebook will mostly consist of exercises to test your comprehension of the reading. "

    "### However, the datatype is important... \n",
    "When you create a numpy array from a list it tries to infer the datatype from contents of the list. Above, when we created a list of all int elements it created an int array. However, when we pass it a list below where some elements are ints and some are strings, it converts everything to strings. **This is because numpy works most efficiently by storing all data in an array as a single datatype**. You can create arrays with a mixed datatype but you lose much of the efficiency of numpy when you do so. "

In addition to the one dimension in which lists can be indexed, however, arrays can be indexed in multiple dimensions to select both rows and columns, and they can apply functions over these indices as well. If you need a refresher on how to `index` and `slice` objects in Python look back at our reading from last week ([link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html)), or google \"python indexing\".

    "## Filling an array with data\n",
    "\n",
    "When learning about lists and dictionaries we learned that a convenient way to use these objects is to first create an empty list or dictionary and then fill it with values as you iterate over some process and append items to the list, or add new key/val pairs to the dictionary. In numpy you have to do things a bit differently. You start by creating an array that is the full size that you plan to work, initialized with some null value like zeros, and then you update the values with new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between these two approaches may seem subtle, but it can lead to huge speed improvements when done correctly in numpy. This is because numpy essentially reserves space in your computers memory for the size of the `array`, whereas a `list` that changes size as you extend it will need to keep updating the object in memory. As explained in your reading, this allows numpy to perform calculations using compiled functions in faster languages like C and fortran; it's a workaround that allows us to write pretty Python code but still benefit from super fast speed. \n",
