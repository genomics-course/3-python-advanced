    "\n",
    "Genomes contain thousands of genes, as well as many other regions that do not contain genes and may or may not have some other function. Genes are often of special interest as they are the units that encode the information for proteins, and therefore for much of the primary biological functions in organisms. The [central dogma of molecular biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology) which relates how information is stored and transferred between DNA, RNA, and proteins was discovered shortly after the discovery that DNA itself was the molecule of genetic information storage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DNA sequence of genes provides the underlying information for gene **transcription**, the first step of gene expression. DNA determines the starting and ending sites, and is a template for the RNA sequence that will be produced. DNA itself simply holds this information in the sequence of its bases. Proteins do most of the actual work of transcribing genes by recognizing certain regions of DNA to bind to, and synthesizing RNA based on the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts are a type of RNA that encodes for an [amino acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid) sequence of a polypeptide (a protein, generally). The codon sequence in mRNA is composed of sets of three bases at a time, starting from a special codon that initiates the sequence called a [start codon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_codon), and ends at a codon that signals the end termed a [stop codon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_codon). The sequence of codons will be **translated** into an amino acid sequence that will fold to form the protein. "

    "We can easily represent the genetic code for translation using a Python dictionary. Here the keys are codons (sets of three bases) and the values are amino acid residues (represented by the shorthand single letter codes: e.g., L = leucine). We can query this dictionary object with a codon \"CTA\" and it will return the amino acid \"L\". "

Your reading for this week on [A guide to eukaryotic genome assembly](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3174) describes a variety of approaches. \n",

    "For example, we can try to infer the location of genes from the DNA sequence itself, as we did above, but for this we generally use additional information beyond the location of methionine and stop codon sites. Instead, we'll look for longer stretches of DNA that represent binding regions for transcriptional proteins. These types of sequences are well characterized since they tend to be highly conserved (they don't accumulate mutations very rapidly and thus tend to be similar among species). The binding of transcription factor proteins to these regions affects how and when genes are transcribed. This is represented in the figure below by a \"promoter\" region. \n",

    "Huge advances have been made in recent years in a technology called RNA-seq (see below and e'll learn much more about this in next week's reading), which allows us to identify the transcribed region through sequencing. Similarly, as was described in your first week's reading, we have long been able to decode the amino acid sequence of proteins -- in fact this was developed before our ability to sequence DNA -- and from the sequence of proteins we infer which regions have been translated or spliced from transcripts.\n",

    "When all of this information is combined together we end up with a **nested set** of hierarchical information, where one feature (e.g., mRNA transcripts) is expected to be associated with one or more other downstream features (exons). We keep track not only of each of these features as they are identified, but also which type of evidence was used to find it in the first place. The GFF file format contains this information. \n",

    "By extracting RNA from an organism, and [reverse transcribing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase) it back to DNA we create [cDNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_DNA). We can then match the cDNA sequence to the genome to figure out which regions were trascribed into RNA. As you can see in the figure, cDNA can then identify the locations of transcripts. Different tissues or organs of an organism might express different genes at different times and so the cDNA from one cell will not match exactly the cDNA of another cell. We will discuss more the use of RNA-seq or exome sequencing later in the class.\n",
